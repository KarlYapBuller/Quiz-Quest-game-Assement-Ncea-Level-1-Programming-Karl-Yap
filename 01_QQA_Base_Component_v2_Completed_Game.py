#Quiz Quest Completed Game
#Quiz Quest Assesment version 2
#Base Component After the Usability testing
#Things that have been fixed include better spacing of the lines outputed, the instructions are more clearer for the User,
#the questions asked to the User are more clearer, titles were added for important sections
#to catch the User attention for what that section is about
#Things that have been added include Constants for
#the reoccuring Error messsages and the comments in the code is more descriptive
#The .format has been changed to f"{}" in the code as it outputs
#the same outcome but it is more redable in the program code
#Emojis in approproate areas have also been added to make the game more visually pleasing for the User

#Constant for the Error message which appears when the User inputs an invalid value
ERROR_MESSAGE = "<ERROR> üòÖ, please input a valid value."
